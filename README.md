# Github Changelog Md <!-- omit in toc -->

This is currently a placeholder for a project to create a tool to generate a
Markdown changelog from a Github repository.

The code is functional but lacking any documentation and a few features that I
want to add before the first proper release.

Documentation will be available on <https://changelog.seapagan.net> very
shortly.
