# Planned features

For now, just some notes to myself. Not all of these will (or should!) be
implemented but it's good to have a list of ideas.

- Implement the basic functionality!
- Get repo information from the current directory, read from the `.git` folder.
  If this is missing (e.g. because the current directory is not a git repo),
  then the user should be able to specify the repo information manually.
- Allow custom sections in the output, set by `label` or a regex.
- Allow custom ordering of sections.
- Allow custom output formats (e.g. HTML, Markdown, PDF, LaTeX, etc.).
- Ability to only update changes and leave the rest of the file untouched
  (allows user customization to the CHANGELOG).
- Ability to specify a custom CHANGELOG file (e.g. `HISTORY.md` or
  `CHANGES.md`).
- Ability to specify a custom template file (e.g. `changelog.jinja`).
- Ability to upload the CHANGELOG to a remote server.
- Edit a GitHub release text with the generated CHANGELOG for that release.
- Allow filtering of commits based on commit message or other criteria.
- Allow customization of the commit message format in the changelog.
- Allow customization of the date format in the changelog.
- Add support for generating changelogs for specific time periods (e.g. last
  week, last month, etc.)
- Add support for generating changelogs for specific contributors, authors or
  teams.
- this app really needs a `local` configuration file, since options may change
  from project to project. This also allows setting the `user` and `repo` etc
  options in this file and not having to specify them on the command line.
  However, **since the config file contains the users PAT, it should be added to
  the project `.gitignore`**. Maybe the config file should be called
  `github-changelog-md.toml`.
- option to include the release body in the changelog, default to false since we
  can probably generate a better changelog than the release body.
- include closed issues in the changelog, linked to the PR that closed them.
- all PRs, Users, Issues etc should be linked to the relevant GitHub page.
- add link in each release to the full GitHub changelog in teh same style as
  GitHub autogenerated release body.
- add ability to create a new release on GitHub with the latest changelog text
  as the body.
- add some form of text or even block to the oldest release that says something
  like "First release" or "Initial release" or "Initial commit" or something
  (configurable) to indicate that this is the first release and nothing to
  compare to. Optionally hide all PR, Issue and commit links in this release.
- add ability to place a section between releases with custom markdown, eg to
  explain changes in the version numbering scheme or other important
  information.
- if there are no PR for a specific release then say something to that effect
  instead of just leaving the section empty.
