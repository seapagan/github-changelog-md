It will also include a list of all Issues closed for each release.</p> <p>The PRs and issues are grouped by type (bug, enhancement, etc.) and sorted by latest to oldest in this release.</p> <p>There is an option to tag all the Unreleased PRs (ie those closed after the previous release) with an upcoming release number to ease the process of creating a new release by having the changelog already up to date, or hide any unreleased PR's completely.</p> <p>While the project is written in Python, it is NOT limited to just generating a changelog for Python projects. It will work with any Github repository and therefore any coding language. In this case a global installation is recommended. Most linux-based systems will already have Python installed, but if not it is easy to install.
