This also allows setting the <code>user</code> and <code>repo</code> etc   options in this file and not having to specify them on the command line.   However, since the config file contains the users PAT, it should be added to   the project <code>.gitignore</code>. Maybe the config file should be called   <code>github-changelog-md.toml</code>.
