# Command Line Options

There are some options you can use to customize the output of the tool.

## `--output` / `-o`

By default the tool will create a `CHANGELOG.md` file in the current folder. You
can specify a different filename using the `--output` or `-o` option.

```terminal
$ github-changelog-md --output HISTORY.md
```

!!! tip ""

    :sparkles: Equivalent to the `output_file` setting in the config file.
---

## `--next-release` / `-n`

This option allows you to specify the name of the next release. By default, any
PRs that are merged after the last existing release will be added to the
`Unreleased` section of the changelog. If you specify a value for this option,
the tool will create a new section with the specified name and add the PRs to
that section instead.

Useful to prep for a release before it is actually released.

```terminal
$ github-changelog-md --next-release 1.2.3
```

!!! tip ""

    :sparkles: There is no equivalent setting in the config file.
---

## `--unreleased` / `--no-unreleased`

Choose whether to include the `Unreleased` section in the changelog. By default
the `Unreleased` section is included (`--unreleased`), but you can use the
`--no-unreleased` option to exclude it

!!! tip ""

    :sparkles: Equivalent to the `unreleased` setting in the config file.
---

## `--depends` / `--no-depends`

Choose whether to include the `Dependency Updates` section in the changelog. By
default this will be shown (`--depends`), but you can use the `--no-depends` to
hide them. Some releases have a lot of dependency updates, so this can be useful
to keep the changelog more readable.

!!! tip ""

    :sparkles: Equivalent to the `depends` setting in the config file.
---

## `--issues` / `--no-issues`

Hide the `Closed Issues` section. By default this section is shown, but you can
use the `--no-issues` option to hide it.

!!! tip ""

    :sparkles: Equivalent to the `show_issues` setting in the config file.
---

## `--contrib` / `--no-contrib`

Choose whether to create the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file. By default this will be
`False` (`--no-contrib`), but you can use the `--contrib` option to enable it.

!!! warning "Possibly LONG operation"

    This can take a while to run, as it has to query the GitHub API for each
    contributor. If you have a lot of contributors or many PR's, it can take a
    few minutes to complete.

    In this case it is recommended to only run this option when you are ready to
    release a new version, and not every time you run the tool.

    In future versions I will add the ability to cache the contributors list,
    which should speed things up a lot

!!! tip ""

    :sparkles: Equivalent to the `contrib` setting in the config file.
---

## `--quiet` / `-q`

By default the tool will output some information about what it is doing, and
some stats about the PRs and Issues it has found. You can use the `--quiet` or
`-q` option to suppress this output.

!!! tip ""

    :sparkles: Equivalent to the `quiet` setting in the config file.
---

## `--skip` / `-s`

This option allows you to skip a release. You can specify this option multiple
times to skip multiple releases. This is useful if you have a release that you
do not want to include in the changelog for some reason.

```terminal
$ github-changelog-md --skip 1.2.3 --skip 1.3-beta1
```

The string specified here is the actual release **`tag`** for that release, not
the release **`name`**.

## `--ignore` / `-e`

Ignore a PR or Issue. You can specify this option multiple times to ignore
multiple PRs or Issues. This is useful if you have a PR or Issue that you do not
want to include in the changelog for some reason.

The integer specified here is the actual PR or Issue **`number`** on GitHub.

```terminal
$ github-changelog-md --ignore 123 --ignore 456
```

!!! tip "Tip"

    You can also add `[no changelog]` anywhere in the PR title, and it will be
    excluded from the changelog. This is case-insensitive, so `[No Changelog]`
    or `[NO CHANGELOG]` will also work.

!!! tip ""

    :sparkles: Equivalent to the `ignore_items` setting in the config file.
---

## `--item-order` / `-i`

This option allows you to specify the order of the PRs and Issues in each
section. By default the order is `newest_first`, but you can use the
`--item-order` or `-i` option to change this to `oldest_first`.

!!! tip ""

    :sparkles: Equivalent to the `item_order` setting in the config file.

## `--max-depends` / `-m`

This option allows you to specify the maximum number of dependency updates to
show for each release. By default this is set to `10`, but you can use the
`--max-depends` or `-m` option to change this.

If you use [Dependabot](https://github.com/apps/dependabot){:target="_blank"} to
handle your dependency updates, this setting can be useful to limit the noise in
the changelog.

!!! tip ""

    :sparkles: Equivalent to the `max_depends` setting in the config file.

## `--show-diff` / `--no-show-diff`

Choose whether to show the diff links for each release. By default this will be
shown (`--show-diff`), but you can use the `--no-show-diff` option to hide them.

!!! tip ""

    :sparkles: Equivalent to the `show_diff` setting in the config file.

## `--show-patch` / `--no-show-patch`

Choose whether to show the patch links for each release. By default this will be
shown (`--show-patch`), but you can use the `--no-show-patch` option to hide
them.

!!! tip ""

    :sparkles: Equivalent to the `show_patch` setting in the config file.`
