# Markdown Changelog Generator

Generate a Markdown changelog from a Github repository.

!!! warning "Under Development"

    This project is still in development and currently has no useable features,
    this webpage and the package on
    [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/github-changelog-md){:target="_blank"}
    are just placeholders for now.

    I expect to have a working version quite soon :wink:, but for now you can
    check out the repository
    [here](https://github.com/seapagan/github-changelog-md){:target="_blank"}.

    Don't forget to star the repository if you want updates on progress :star:!
